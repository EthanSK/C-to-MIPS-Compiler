# C90 (ANSI) to MIPS Compiler

### Introduction

This is a (non fully featured) compiler written in C++ for ANSI C89/C90.
It conforms to this specification: https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2018-cw   


### Testbench
The testbench runs unit tests to test the C to Python translator and the compiler itself.  The compiler unit tests only run on ubuntu, with ```mips-linux-gnu-gcc``` and ```qemu-mips``` installed.

The compiler tests can be run using: 
 
```test/compiler/src/runTests.sh```

and the C to Python translator tests can be run using:   

```test/pythonTranslator/src/runTests.sh```


You will see a ```pythonTranslator``` folder in ```test/compiler/tests```. These were generated by a tool, ```devtools/translatorToCompilerTests.sh```, that converts C to Python translator tests into compiler tests.
